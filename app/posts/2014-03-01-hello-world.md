Perhaps this will join the ranks of blogs that announce their arrival, to never be heard from again. But I would like to give it a try.

Thanks, [Justin Searls](https://twitter.com/searls) and the [Test Double](http://testdouble.com/) crew for [Lineman](http://linemanjs.com/) and the accompanying [lineman-blog tool](https://github.com/linemanjs/lineman-blog).

I was interested in learning and experimenting with a tool beyond [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which has served me well for sites like [Michigan Flyers](http://michiganflyers.org/) and even for those with the complexity of [Nutshell](http://www.nutshell.com/).

Justin gave [a great talk on Javascript testing](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/javascript-testing-tactics) at [SEM.js](http://www.meetup.com/SEM-JS/) which showed off a lot of the Lineman tooling.

I'm inspired by the blogs of people like [Tom MacWright](http://www.macwright.org/) and [Nelson Minar](http://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/), and teams like [Etsy](http://codeascraft.com/), [Test Double](http://blog.testdouble.com/) and [thoughtbot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/).
